Presentation
============

I'm Marc-Aurele and I'm a Python developer for three years now. Most of my development right now was on web projects and REST API with Django.
For my work I also use frontend frameworks like Angular and VueJS.

Why Python ?
============

Python language is used in a wide variety of domains, especially in data science and AI

The big plus of this language is, for me, the number of implementation available. When you hear of Python most of the time we made reference to the CPython implementation, but others exist.

:PyPy_:
    This implementation is used to have better performance with the use of a JIT compiler.
:Stackless_:
    A modified version of Python that allows "to reap the benefits of thread-based programming" but "without the performance and complexity problems associated with conventional threads".
:MicroPython_:
    A version of Python 3 optimized to run on  microchips and in constrained environments
